                  As car dealers, we can sometimes begin relationships with vendors based on the
                  "wow" factor of what we believe their product can yield our dealerships. Often,
                  these relationships fall short of expectations because the product does not
                  deliver as promised and the company overpromises and underdelivers when it comes
                  to customer service and overall responsiveness.
                  <br />
                  This has certainly not been the case with the team at RunMyLease. Not only has the
                  "Unlock Price" product yielded the highest closing percentages of all of our lead
                  sources, the customer service has been phenomenal. Simple tool, exceptional
                  results and service.

                  At the Swickard Auto Group we started working with RunMyLease during the early
                  days of the COVID pandemic. With a higher percentage of our customers seeking us
                  out online, we wanted to open communication lines with them as quickly as possible
                  while still protecting our pricing information from competitors.
                  <br />
                  We immediately saw an increase in lead volume and more importantly lead quality
                  following the addition of the RunMyLease Unlock Price Tool to our website’s SRP
                  and VDP pages. In addition to just a cleaner user experience, we felt as though it
                  gave us extra credibility with our online shoppers as they saw we weren’t just
                  begging for their information but were rather indicating that we also had
                  something of value that we only wanted to share with confirmed potential buyers.
                  <br />
                  We definitely feel that RunMyLease has made us a better online dealership group
